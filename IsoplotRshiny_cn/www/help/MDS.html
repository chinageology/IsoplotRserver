Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) is a dimension-reducting technique that
takes a matrix of pairwise 'dissimilarities' between objects (e.g.,
detrital age distributions) as input and produces a configuration of
two (or higher-) coordinates as output, so that the Euclidean distance
between these coordinates approximates the dissimilarities of the
input matrix. Thus, an MDS-configuration serves as a 'map' in which
similar samples cluster closely together and dissimilar samples plot
far apart. In the context of detrital geochronology, the dissimilarity
between samples is given by the statistical distance between age
distributions. There are many ways to define this statistical distance.
<tt>IsoplotR</tt> uses the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic for this
purpose due to its simplicity and the fact that it behaves like a true
distance in the mathematical sense of the word (Vermeesch, 2013,
2018). The KS-distance is closely related to the CAD-plot.  It is
given by the maximum vertical distance between two CAD step
functions. Thus, the KS-distance takes on values between zero (perfect
match between two age distributions) and one (no overlap between two
distributions).  Calculating the KS-distance between samples two at a
time populates a symmetric dissimilarity matrix with positive values
and a zero diagonal. <tt>IsoplotR</tt> implements two algorithms to
convert this matrix into a configuration. The first ('classical' MDS)
approach uses a sequence of basic matrix manipulations to achieve a
linear fit between the KS-distances and the fittted distances on the
MDS configuration. The second, more sophisticated ('nonmetric' MDS)
approach subjects the input distances to a transformation f prior to
fitting a configuration:

<p></p>
&delta;<sub>i,j</sub> = f(KS<sub>i,j</sub>)
<p></p>

where KS<sub>i,j</sub> is the KS-distance between samples i and j (for
1 &le; i &ne; j &le; n) and &delta;<sub>i,j</sub> is the 'disparity'.
Fitting an MDS configuration then involves finding the disparity
transformation that maximises the goodness of fit (or minimises the
'stress') between the disparities and the fitted distances. The latter
two quantities can also be plotted against each other as a 'Shepard
plot'. Additional options and higher order alternatives to these MDS
algorithms are provided in a separate <tt>R</tt>-package called
