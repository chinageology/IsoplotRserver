The fission track age is given by:

<p></p>
t = 
ln[
1 + {2 N<sub>s</sub>&lambda;<sub>238</sub>&lambda;<sub>f</sub>}
/
{[<sup>238</sup>U]A<sub>s</sub>L}
] / &lambda;<sub>238</sub>
<span class="alignright">(eq. 1)</span>
<p></p>

where N<sub>s</sub> is the number of spontaneous fission tracks
measured over an area A<sub>s</sub>, [<sup>238</sup>U] is the
<sup>238</sup>U-concentration in atoms per unit volume,
&lambda;<sub>f</sub> is the fission decay constant, L is the etchable
fission track length, and the factor 2 is a geometric factor
accounting for the fact that etching reveals tracks from both above
and below the internal crystal surface.

<p></p>

<div class="show4EDM hide4absolute hide4ICP">
[<sup>238</sup>U] can be measured indirectly using the induced fission
of neutron-irradiated <sup>235</sup>U as a proxy for
the <sup>238</sup>U. In the most common implementation of this
approach, the induced fission tracks are recorded by an external
detector made of mica or plastic that is attached to the polished
grain surface (Fleischer and Hart, 1972; Hurford and Green, 1983). The
fission track age equation then becomes:

<p></p>
t =
ln[
1 + {&lambda;<sub>238</sub>&zeta;&rho;<sub>d</sub>N<sub>s</sub>}
/
{2 N<sub>i</sub>}
] / &lambda;<sub>238</sub>
<span class="alignright">(eq. 2)</span>
<p></p>

where N<sub>i</sub> is the number of induced fission tracks counted in
the external detector over the same area as the spontaneous tracks,
&zeta; is a 'zeta'-calibration factor that incorporates both the
fission decay constant and the etchable fission track length, and
&rho;<sub>d</sub> is the number of induced fission tracks per unit
area counted in a co-irradiated glass of known
U-concentration. &rho;<sub>d</sub> allows the &zeta;-factor to be
'recycled' between irradiations.

<div class="hide4EDM hide4absolute show4ICP">
The <sup>238</sup>U-concentration can also be measured directly by
LAICPMS. Unfortunately the accuracy of LAICPMS-based age estimates is
compromised by the absence of matrix-matched concentrations standards,
and uncertainies associated with the fission track decay constant and
the etching and counting efficiencies.  These systematic errors can be
removed by normalising to a standard of known fission track age and
defining a new 'zeta' calibration constant &zeta;<sub>icp</sub>:

<p></p>
t =
ln( 1 + {2 &zeta;<sub>icp</sub> &lambda;<sub>238</sub>N<sub>2</sub>}
/
{[<sub>238</sub>U] A<sub>s</sub>}
) / &lambda;<sub>238</sub>
<span class="alignright">(eq. 2)</span>
<p></p>

where [<sup>238</sup>U] may either stand for the
<sup>238</sup>U-concentration (in ppm) <i>or</i> for the U/Ca (for
apatite) or U/Si (for zircon) ratio measurement, and A<sub>s</sub> is
the spontaneous track counting area, which may either correspond to
one laser spot or to a larger area (if multiple U-measurements were
made).
