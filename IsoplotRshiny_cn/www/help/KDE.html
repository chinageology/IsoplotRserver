Histograms smooth data by binning. <tt>IsoplotR</tt> uses Sturges'
Rule (log<sub>2</sub>[n]+1, where n is the number of data points) as
the default number of histogram bins, but this can be changed to any
other natural number by the user. Alternatively, kernel density
estimates KDEs (Vermeesch, 2012) smooth data by applying a (Gaussian)
kernel:

<p></p>
KDE(t) = &sum;<sub>i</sub><i>N</i>
(t | &mu;=t<sub>i</sub>, &sigma;=h[t])
<span class="alignright">(eq. 1)</span>
<p></p>

where <i>N</i>(&mu;,&sigma;) is the probability of observing a value t
under a Normal distribution with mean &mu; and standard deviation
&sigma;.  h[t] is the smoothing parameter or 'bandwidth' of the kernel
density estimate which may or may not depend on the age t. If h[t]
depends on t, then KDE(t) is known as an 'adaptive' KDE.  The default
bandwidth used by <tt>IsoplotR</tt> is calculated using the algorithm
of Botev et al. (2010) and modulated by the adaptive smoothing
approach of Abramson (1982). The rationale behind adaptive kernel
density estimation is to use a narrower bandwidth near the peaks fo
the sampling distribution (where the ordered dates are closely spaced
in time), and a wider bandwidth in the distribution's sparsely sampled
troughs. Thus, the resolution of the density estimate is optimised
according to data availability. Kernel density estimates are not to be
confused with <tt>Isoplot</tt>'s 'probability density plots'
(PDPs). The mathematical definition of a PDP closely resembles that of
the KDE, the only difference being the substitution of the bandwidth
h[t] by the analytical uncertainty s[t<sub>i</sub>] in Equation
1. This similarity in appearance and definition is the source of much
confusion. PDPs do not stand up to further statistical scrutiny (see
counter-examples provided by Vermeesch, 2012), and are not implemented
in <tt>IsoplotR</tt>.
