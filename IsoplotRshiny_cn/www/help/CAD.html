Empirical cumulative distribution functions or cumulative age
distributions CADs (Vermeesch, 2007) are the most
straightforward way to visualise the probability distribution of
multiple dates. A CAD is a step function that sets out the rank order
of the dates against their numerical value:

<p></p>
  CAD(t) = &sum;<sub>i</sub> 1(t &lt; t<sub>i</sub>)/n
<span class="alignright">(eq. 1)</span>
<p></p>

where 1(*) = 1 if * is true and 1(*) = 0 if * is false. CADs have two
desirable properties. First, they do not require any pre-treatment or
smoothing of the data. This is not the case for histograms or kernel
density estimates.  Second, it is easy to superimpose several CADs on
the same plot.  This facilitates the intercomparison of multiple
samples. The interpretation of CADs is straightforward but not very
intuitive. The prominence of individual age components is proportional
to the steepness of the CAD. This is different from probability
density estimates such as histograms, in which such components stand
out as peaks. It is arguably easier to identify peaks than inflection
points and this probably why CADs are not as widely used as
probability density estimates. But the ease of interpretation of
density estimates comes at a cost, as they require smoothing and
cannot as easily be combined as CADs.
