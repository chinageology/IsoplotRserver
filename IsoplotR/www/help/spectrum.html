The <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar-age spectrum is a useful tool to
visualise stepwise heating measurements. Its appearance is based on
the weighted mean plot with the different heating steps arranged in
order of increasing temperature along the horizontal axis, and the
width of the different sample boxes proportional to the corresponding
amounts of <sup>39</sup>Ar. <tt>IsoplotR</tt> defines the 'plateau
age' as the weighted mean age of the longest sequence (in terms of
cumulative <sup>39</sup>Ar content) of consecutive heating steps that
pass a modified Chauvenet criterion.  This definition is different
(and simpler) than the one used by <tt>Isoplot</tt> (Ludwig,
2003). However, it is important to mention that all definitions of an
age plateau are heuristic by nature and should therefore not be used
for quantitative inference.  It is possible (and likely) that the
plateau exhibits significant overdispersion. This overdispersion can
be manually reduced by removing individual heating steps using the
optional <tt>omit</tt> column.
