Let t = {t<sub>1</sub>, ..., t<sub>n</sub>} be a set of n age
estimates determined on different aliquots of the same sample, and let
s[t<sub>1</sub>], ..., s[t<sub>n</sub>]} be their analytical
uncertainties (standard errors). <tt>IsoplotR</tt> implements two ways
to compute the average of these data:

<ol>
  <li>A random effects model with two sources of variance:

    <p></p>
    t<sub>i</sub> ~ <i>N</i>( &mu;, &sigma;<sup>2</sup> =
    s[t<sub>i</sub>]<sup>2</sup> + &omega;<sup>2</sup> )
    <span class="alignright">(eq. 1a)</span>
    <p></p>

    where &mu; is the mean, &sigma;<sup>2</sup> is the total variance and
    &omega; is the 'overdispersion'. Equation 1a can be solved for &mu; and
    &omega; by the method of maximum likelihood.

  </li>
  <li>A weighted mean algorithm that assumes that any dispersion
  between the different aliquots is only due to the analytical
    uncertainty:

    <p></p>
    <span style="text-decoration: overline">t</span> =
    &Sigma;(t<sub>i</sub>/s[t<sub>i</sub>]<sup>2</sup>)/&Sigma;(1/s[t<sub>i</sub>]<sup>2</sup>)<span class="alignright">(eq. 1b)</span>
    <p></p>

  </li>
</ol>

<tt>IsoplotR</tt> uses a modified version of Chauvenet's criterion for
outlier detection:

<ol>
<li> Compute the error-weighted mean of the n age determinations
  t<sub>i</sub> using their analytical uncertainties s[t<sub>i</sub>]
  using one of the aforementioned two approaches.
</li>
<li> For each t<sub>i</sub>, compute the probability p<sub>i</sub>
  that that |t-&mu;|>|t<sub>i</sub>-&mu;| for
<p>
  t ~ <i>N</i>(0,&Xi;<sup>2</sup>) <span class="alignright">(eq. 2)</span>
</p>
where &Xi; = &radic;<span style="text-decoration: overline;">
  s[t<sub>i</sub>]<sup>2</sup>+&omega;<sup>2</sup> </span> if the
  random effects model is used; or &Xi; =
  s[<span style="text-decoration:
  overline">t</span>]&radic;<span style="text-decoration:
  overline;">MSWD</span> if the ordinary weighted mean is used.
</li>
<li>
  Let p<sub>j</sub> &equiv; min(p<sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,p<sub>n</sub>).
  If p<sub>j</sub><0.05/n, then reject the j<sup>th</sup> date, reduce
  n by one (i.e., n &rarr; (n-1) and repeat steps 1 through 3 until
  the surviving dates pass the third step.
</li>
</ol>

If the analytical uncertainties are small compared to the scatter
between the dates, then this generalised algorithm reduces to the
conventional Chauvenet criterion. If the analytical uncertainties are
large and the data do not exhibit any overdispersion, then the
heuristic outlier detection method is equivalent to Ludwig (2003)'s
'modified 2-sigma' method.
