<tt>IsoplotR</tt> offers three ways to fit a straight line through
2-dimensional data with measurement uncertainties:

<ol>
  <li>Model-1: maximum Likelihood regression, using the modified error
      weighted least squares algorithm of York et al. (2004) This
      algorithm takes into account the analytical uncertainties and
      error correlations, under the assumption that the scatter
      between the data points is solely caused by the analytical
      uncertainty. If the assumption is correct, then the MSWD value
      should be approximately equal to one. If MSWD > 1, then model-1
      regression assumes that the analytical uncertainties have been
      underestimated by a factor &radic;MSWD.
  </li>
  <li>Model-2: ordinary least squares regression, ignoring the
  analytical uncertainties.
  </li>
  <li>Model-3: maximum likelihood regression with
  overdispersion. Instead of attributing any overdispersion (MSWD > 1)
  to underestimated analytical uncertainties, one can also attribute
  it to the presence of geological uncertainty, which manifests itself
  as an added (co)variance term.
  </li>
</ol>
